From the colour organs of past centuries, to todayâ€™s VJing and new media art performances, artists and scientists have shown perpetual interest in the live performance of visual imagery.

The limited aesthetic flexibility permitted by existing tools however has meant that artists striving to differentiate their work have most often been the inventors and creators of the tools they use.

To address this obstacle, we have developed a set of tools, that make use of and extend the popular Processing open-source multimedia programming environment.

Together they will enable artists without the skills of computer programming to significantly influence the content of their visual performance, while also keeping the programming of new graphics algorithms accessible to those seeking greater creative freedom.

I have tried to consolidate documentation in as few places as possible, to keep it simple to maintain.

For information on how this library works, simply download the Mother.zip file and read the included PDF.

Note that the downloads available from Google code are old, and Google does not allow me to add new downloads as the download service is discontinued!

The following link will always refer to the latest version:
