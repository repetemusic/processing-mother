
To get the included examples running, follow the following steps:

1. Copy Gradient.jar and Waltz.jar to wherever you want to keep your synths.

2. Update mother.ini to refer to that path, eg: SynthFolder=X:\\Stuff\\My Synths;
   Also create subfolders "data" and "libraries", 
   e.g. X:\Stuff\My Synths\data and X:\Stuff\My Synths\libraries.

3. Start "Mother_Controller_Example - 0.3.exe", 
   and make sure to allow it through any firewalls you have, 
   or it will not be able to communicate with Mother.

3. - Alternative: 	Download and install Pure Data extended from: http://puredata.info/downloads,
					and open the pd patch "PureData controller example.pd",
					included with this Mother distribution.  

4. Start Mother.exe, add an instance of each synth using the controller example buttons, 
   and try out the various adjustments.

5. Read the included documentation, documentation related to using OSC (http://opensoundcontrol.org/), 
   and get started making your own synths and user interfaces for controlling them!

If it doesn't work right away:

	* Make sure you are pointing mother to a valid filepath for the synths, 
	  and that you are using the double backslash '\\' in the path.
	  
	* Make sure you graphics card and the installed drivers support OpenGL 2.0
	
	* Make sure the communication between the controller and Mother is not blocked by a firewall,
	  and that the network ports specified in Mother.ini are available.
